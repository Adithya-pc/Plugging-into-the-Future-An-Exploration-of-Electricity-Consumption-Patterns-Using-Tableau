#Plugging into the Future: An Exploration of Electricity Consumption Patterns Using Tableau
The Electricity Consumption Analysis Dashboard is an interactive visualization tool that examines electricity usage across states, regions, and time periods. It highlights patterns such as seasonal demand, regional variations, and metro city consumption. The dashboard also shows changes before and after lockdown periods to reveal shifts in usage behavior. These insights support better energy planning, demand forecasting, and efficient power distribution.
